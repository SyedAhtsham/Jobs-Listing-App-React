useEffect:

We'll make a request suing the useEffect
we'll not have the jobs until the component loads through the useEffect, and then

we will fill the component fields with the data using the API

we need to create a proxy, localhose:8000/jobs will not work on the 
deployed version, therefore, we need to have somthing like this ./jobs/1

data fetching using useEffect,

react-suspense

fetch on render useEffect

render while fetching, a fallback UI is provided while the data is being fetched

useParams is a react hook through which we can use the id passed through
url inside the page
